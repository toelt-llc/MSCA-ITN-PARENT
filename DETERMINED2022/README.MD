# Introduction to TensorFlow Keras

For this lecture I prepared two notebooks that are very easy and can be tested in Google Colab without installing anything on your laptop. By clicking the links below an instance of Google Colab will open with the notebook ready for you to try.

- [Your first neural network with Keras](https://colab.research.google.com/github/toelt-llc/MSCA-ITN-PARENT/blob/main/DETERMINED2022/Introduction%20to%20TensorFlow%20Keras/code/Easy_Network_with_Keras.ipynb)
