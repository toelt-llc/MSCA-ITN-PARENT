 >Determining if ML is a good approach for a problem.  
### [How models work](https://www.kaggle.com/code/dansbecker/how-models-work/tutorial) 
>Part of a Machine Learning introduction done by [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com).  
We recommend completing the 7 steps as it uses code examples in parallel with the explanations.  Programming and Python introduction are [also available](https://www.kaggle.com/learn).  
### [Practical Walkthrough (blogpost)](https://towardsdatascience.com/introduction-to-artificial-intelligence-machine-learning-and-deep-learning-with-tensorflow-b5fa20477e89) 
> An other introduction to AI, what Machine and Deep Learning mean.
